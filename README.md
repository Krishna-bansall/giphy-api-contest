Down below is a little *Tutorial/Guide* of how you can make this application

## Pre-Requisites ‚úíÔ∏è

This is a begginer-intermediate level front-end project so i assume you must have basic html-css knowledge and these js topics üëáüèª 

 - [DOM Manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
 - [API Fetching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
 - [Async-Await / Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) 

Knowledge of ES6 Syntax would benefit you greatly, Also you're free to use any sort of frameworks like React, Jquery, Vue, Bootstrap. I Just want the shit get built

Feel Free to use modules like Axios as well,  I used vanilla js tho
## How do I Build This??

Alright Krishna it's cool and stuff but how do i build this? 
It's not hard really let me tell you how do to it 

 1. **Get Your API Keys**  - First things first  register on giphy developer portal, login and create an app with giphy api (don't use SDK)

2. **Set Up Your Search Bar** - This is also Fairly Easy, Just go ahead and setup your boilerplate or framework & Build a search bar
3. **Set Up Your Javascript** - Go and just query elements that you require and assign them to a variable
4. **Fetch Data from API** - Fetch your data, and at this point I would reccomend you to go a read to Giphy Docs and try to understand how their API  works, Maybe play with it a little
5.  **Find a way to display Gif's** - When your data is fetching fine you have to a find a way to display the gif's on screen. I want you to figure how to do that there can be multiple ways to do it, No single way is the correct way. As long as it works I dont care how you do it
6.  **Get Creative** - This is the most important step, you will be provided the code for the above steps. But creativity is something unique to you. I've provided you with a barebone app which is kinda slow and shitty and looks dead, How can you make the app *more beautiful*? *More efficient*? *More unique* than others. That's something you want to work on!
 
## Footnotes
I want everyone to try building this app, get your ide's running, get creative! Build something cool and win the contest, Dont try to just copy my code. Try to stackoveflow a bit. Come up with your own solutions. Admins and mods are always there to help! Dont Hesitate to Tag, All the best üëç

Submit your codes on github to participate in the contest

**NOTE - Make a seperate branch with your name and do a pull request, DO NOT COMMIT  TO MAIN BRANCH**
